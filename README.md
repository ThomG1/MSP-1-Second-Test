# Replica Recordings

The Replica Recordings is a record label celebrating new and underground alternative music from South Wales. This website is a place that both looks to platform the artists that have released music on the label, and serve as an invitation for new artists to connect and create with the label also.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Artist page and Demo page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- __The Logo__
 
  - Whilst part of the Navbar, it's important to highlight the logo on the left hand side. The logo contains the signature Replica Recordings image, flanked by two 'R' letters serving as both the quickest possible way for a user to identify the brand, and an eye-catching anchor at the top of the page that will return the user to the home page from any part of the site. 
  

- __The landing page image__

  - The landing includes a image with text overlay to allow the user to see the actual name and description of the brand for the first time. 
  - This section uses a deliberately abstract yet eye catching image as a background for the text and description while also helping to create an initial atmosphere for the site.

- __About Section__

  - The 'About' section will allow the user to quickly immerse themselves in the ethos of the label and encourage users to explore the other sections of the site.
  - This user will quickly understand the value the label places on it's artists and the music it releases and be encouraged to do the same. This should result in the user to begin exploring the artists, or be inspired to get involved in the label themselves.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section is split in two halves. The left half includes links to the social media sites for Replica Recordins under a 'Find Us' heading. The right half includes links to streaming platforms so they user can engage directly with the content being released by the label and it's artists. All links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it directs them straight to the musical content, and social media links to follow and engage with on an ongoing basis.
